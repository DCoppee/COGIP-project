## Installation

### Prerequisites

You must have installed on your computer:
- PHP
- Composer
- React
- Node.Js (npm)

Clone this repository: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gollumeo/cogip.git
```

### Back-end

Install all the dependencies using composer:
```bash
composer install
```

Separate the backend folder, so you can access the API directly from the browser.
Run the PHP Server:
```bash
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
```

Or you can access it from the hosted [website](https://cogip-api.pierre-mauriello.be/invoices) directly.
Don't forget to refer to the [API documentation](./endpoints.md)!

### Front-end

Install all the dependencies using npm:
```bash
npm install
```

Run the React Server:
```bash
npm run lh
```

Have fun browsing!

And if you ever want to build your own version of the app, you can run:
```bash
npm run build-r
```

Now you can serve it with a static server:
```bash
npm install -g serve
serve -s build
```

I hope you enjoy our project! :smile:

We are, of course, open to issues and improvements, so feel free to contribute!
